abstract = "Several works have addressed the problem of detecting manipulations in images acquired from devices that use colour filter arrays, typical in the market due to low production costs. These devices use chromatic interpolation algorithms during the image formation process, allowing them to perform statistical analyses of inconsistencies generated from this process for authentication purposes. Most of the works focus on analysing the green band of the Bayer filter since it contains more information than blue and red bands. The lack of methods for effectively analysing other bands or different colour filters reduces the detection capability of known tools. The main purpose of this work is to provide a general methodology for detecting manipulations in this type of devices, in addition to providing new techniques that allow generalising the analysis in a great diversity of sensors."
