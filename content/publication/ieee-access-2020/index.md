abstract: Multimedia files play an important role in everyday life. Today, the majority of the population owns state-of-the-art cameras integrated into their mobile devices. Technological development not only facilitates the generation of multimedia content, but also the intentional manipulation of it, and this is where forensic techniques of detecting manipulation on images and videos take on great importance. Although historically there has been confidence in the integrity of images, the advance of technology has begun to erode this confidence. This work proposes a digital image authentication method based on the quadratic mean error of the Color Filter Array interpolation pattern estimated from the analysed image. For the evaluation of the proposed method, experiments were carried out with public databases of forged images that are widely developed for research purposes. The results of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
